# accounting-tech-demo
The result is a simple account administration tool for the office assistant to use for registering expenses and income, the ceo/cfo to check different views. First this will be static and later if we have the time, we can add creating views/user defined fields etc.  The goal for this project is to have a playing field to test databases mysql/nosql and other technologies that we can use for TeamSupport
Also this will be my first project on Github
